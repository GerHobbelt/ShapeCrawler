ShapeCrawler (formerly SlideDotNet) is a .NET library for manipulating PowerPoint presentations. It provides a simplified object model on top of the [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK), allowing users to process presentations without having Microsoft Office installed.

#### Read presentation

```c#
// open existing presentation
using var pres = SCPresentation.Open("some.pptx");

var shapeCollection = pres.Slides[0].Shapes;

// get number of shapes on slide
var slidesCount = shapeCollection.Count;

// get text
var autoShape = shapeCollection.GetByName<IAutoShape>("TextBox 1");
var text = autoShape.TextFrame!.Text;
```

#### Create presentation

```c#
// create a new presentation
var pres = SCPresentation.Create();

var shapeCollection = pres.Slides[0].Shapes;

// add new shape
var addedShape = shapeCollection.AutoShapes.AddRectangle(x: 50, y: 60, w: 100, h: 70);

addedShape.TextFrame!.Text = "Hello World!";
